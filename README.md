# A basic RESTful API using FLASK **_2.0_**

## Here I've implemented five http methods like

- `GET`
- `POST`
- `PUT`
- `PATCH`
- `DELETE`

## and also connected it to `MONGO DB` so to learn `falsk 2.0` and basics of pymongo _(mongo db driver in python)_ functions and schema validation **check out this repo.**
